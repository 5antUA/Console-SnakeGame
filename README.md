A simple SnakeGame developed as a console application using the C# programming language.

The application contains three .cs files in the "included files" folder:
* Program.cs - the entry point of the application that contains the Main() function;
* Snake.cs - game data and game logic;
* Vector.cs - a struct for storing two variables X and Y that represent a point in the coordinate system.
